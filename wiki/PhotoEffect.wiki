Photo effects allow you to define specific effects and apply them to your photos and photo sizes. Photologue leverages the Python Imaging Library to provide the following adjustments and filters:

== Adjustments ==
  * Color
  * Brightness
  * Contrast
  * Sharpness
  
== Filters ==
  * Blur
  * Contour
  * Detail
  * Edge Enhance
  * Edge Enhance More
  * Emboss
  * Find Edges
  * Sharpen
  * Smooth
  * Smooth More
  
_This list may change depending on the continued development of the Python Imaging Library._

== Admin Preview ==
Photologue automatically generates a sample image in the Django admin so that you can preview the effect (click image to enlarge).
