= Install Photologue =

== Get The Files ==

You can download the "stable" version of Photologue [http://code.google.com/p/django-photologue/downloads/list here] or you can check out the newest version using subversion from [http://django-photologue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/photologue/ http://django-photologue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/photologue/].

== Install The App ==

  * Create a new directory named "django_apps" somewhere on your Python path (such as Lib/site-packages).
  * Unzip or copy the Photogue application directory into your "django_apps" directory.
  * Add "django_apps.photologue" your installed_apps setting:

{{{
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # other installed apps
    'django_apps.photologue',
)
}}}

  * Add this to yourproject.urls:

{{{
urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'^photologue/', include('django_apps.photologue.urls')),
)
}}}

Be sure your MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT settings are correct!

== Optional Steps ==

  * Create a new PhotoSize with the name "thumbnail" to get thumbnail previews in the admin interface.
  * Copy the included example templates into one of your TEMPLATE_DIRS (under a subdirectory named "photologue") and modify as needed.
