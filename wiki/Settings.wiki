#Photologue configuration settings

The following settings can be overridden in your sites settings.py file:

=== PHOTOLOGUE_DIR ===
Default: 'photologue'

The relative path (from your MEDIA_ROOT setting) where photologue will store image files.

=== PHOTOLOGUE_MAXBLOCK ===
_New in Trunk > Rev 96_

Default: 64*1024

Overides the default ImageFile.MAXBLOCK buffer size. Setting this value higher may help avoid [http://code.google.com/p/django-photologue/issues/detail?id=11 Issue #11].
