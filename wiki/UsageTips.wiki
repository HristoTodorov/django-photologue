Some usage tips and some features that may not be obvious.

== Upload a .zip file ==

To upload a gallery of images at once as a zip file just "add" a `GalleryUpload`, select the zip file and fill in the required fields.

== Admin thumbnails ==

To get a thumbnail preview of your photos in the Django admin just define a `PhotoSize` with the name "thumbnail".

{{{
PhotoSize.objects.create(name="thumbnail", width=100, height=75, quality=80)
}}}

Of course you can also define `PhotoSizes` through the Admin interface.
