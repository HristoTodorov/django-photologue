Some usage tips and some features that may not be obvious.

== Admin Thumbnails ==

To get a thumbnail preview of your photos in the Django admin just define a `PhotoSize` with the name "thumbnail" (can be any size you want).

{{{
PhotoSize.objects.create(name="thumbnail", width=100, height=75)
}}}

Of course you can also define `PhotoSizes` through the Admin interface.

== Sharpen Thumbnails ==

To get better looking thumbnails, create a `FilterSet` and add the "Sharpen" filter. Now, apply this filter set to your thumbnail `PhotoSize` and your thumbnails will be regenerated. Experiment by combining `Filters` within `FilterSets` to create effects.

== Upload A .zip File ==

To upload a gallery of images at once as a zip file just "add" a `GalleryUpload`, select the zip file and fill in the required fields.
